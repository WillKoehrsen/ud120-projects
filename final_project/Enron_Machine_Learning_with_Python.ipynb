    "The Enron email + financial dataset is a large trove of information regarding the Enron Corporation, an energy, commodities, and services company that infamously went bankrupt in December 2001 as a result of fradulent business practices. In the aftermath of the company's collapse, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission released more 1.6 million emails sent and received by Enron executives in the years from 2000-2002 ([History of Enron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enron). After numerous complaints regarding the sensitive nature of the emails, the FERC redacted a large portion of the emails, but about 0.5 million remained [available to the public](https://www.technologyreview.com/s/515801/the-immortal-life-of-the-enron-e-mails/). The email + financial data contains all of the emails, meta data about the emails such as number received and sent for each individual, and financial information such as salary and stock options. (The dataset, along with several functions used in this report, is available on [Udacity's GitHub](https://github.com/udacity/ud120-projects).) The dataset has become a playground for machine learning practicioners eager to try to develop models that can identify persons of interests, defined as an individual who was eventually tried for fraud in the Enron investigation. The goal of this project was to develop a model that could pick out the POI's. I choose not to use the text of the email's themselves, but rather the metadata about the emails as well as the financial information. The ultimate objective of investigating the Enron dataset is to be able to predict cases of fraud or unsafe business practices far in advance, so those responsible can be punished, and those who are innocent are not harmed. Machine learning holds the promise to a world where there are no more Enrons, but let's not get ahead of ourselves just yet! "

However, for the email data, NaNs stand for unknown information. Therefore, I will replace any financial data that is NaN with 0 but will fill in the NaNs for the email data with the mean of the column grouped by person of interest. In other words, if a person has a NaN value for 'to_messages', and they are a person of interest, I will fill in that value with the mean value of 'to_messages' for a person of interest. If I chose to drop the NaNs, that would reduce the size of what is already a small dataset. As the quality of a machine learning model is proportional to the amount of data fed into it, I am hesitant to remove any information that could possibly be of use. "

    "1. Kenneth Lay, [the CEO of Enron from 1986-2001](http://www.biography.com/people/kenneth-lay-234611), presided over many of the illegal business activites and hence is one of the most important persons of interest. \n",

Mark Frevert served as chief executive of [Enron Europe from 1986-2000 and was appointed as chairman of Enron in 2001](http://www.risk.net/risk-management/2123422/ten-years-after-its-collapse-enron-lives-energy-markets). He was a major player in the firm, although not a person of interest. I believe that he is not representative of the average employee at Enron during this time because of his substantial compensation and will remove him from the dataset. \n",
    "3. Timothy Belden was the [former head of trading for Enron](http://articles.latimes.com/2007/feb/15/business/fi-enron15) who developed the strategy to illegally raise energy prices in California. He was a person of interest and will definitely remain in the dataset. \n",
    "4. Jeffrey Skilling [replaced Kenneth Lay as CEO of Enron in 2001 and orchestrated much of the fraud](http://www.biography.com/people/jeffrey-skilling-235386) that destroyed Enron. As a person of interest, he will remain in the dataset. \n",
    "5. John Baxter was a former vice Enron vice chairman and [died of an apparent self-inflicted gunshot](https://www.wsws.org/en/articles/2002/01/enro-j28.html) before he was able to testify against other Enron executives. I will remove him from the dataset as he is not a person of interest. \n",
    "6. John Lavorato was a top executive in the energy-trading branch of Enron and received large bonuses to [keep him from leaving Enron](http://www.nytimes.com/2002/06/18/business/officials-got-a-windfall-before-enron-s-collapse.html). As he was not a person of interest, and the large bonus ended up skewing his total pay towards the top of the range, I think it would be appropriate to remove him from the dataset. \n",
    "7. Lawrence Whalley [served as the president of Enron](http://www.corpwatch.org/article.php?id=13194) and fired Andrew Fastow once it was apparent the severity of Enron's situation. He was investigated thoroughly but not identified as a person of interest and therefore will be removed from the dataset.  \n",

    "Total, I decided to remove four people from the dataset. I believe these removals are justified primarily because none of these individuals were persons of interest and they all were upper-level executives with pay levels far above the average employee.

    "I now want to try training some algorithms on all of the initial features in the dataset to gauge the importance of features and to see what the accuracy is like without any parameter tuning. \n",
    "The four algorithms I have selected for initial testing are Gaussian Naive Bayes (GaussianNB), DecisionTreeClassifier, Support Vector Classifier (SVC), and KMeans Clustering. I will run the algorithms with the default parameters except I will alter the kernel used in the Support Vector Machine to be linear. I will also select number of clusters = 2 for KMeans as I know in advance that there are two categories that should be classified by the model. Although accuracy would appear to be the obvious choice for evaluating the quality of a classifier, accuracy can be a crude measure at times, and is not suited for some datasets including this one. For example, if a classifier were to guess that all of the samples in the cleaned dataset were _not_ persons of interest, it would have an accuracy of 87.1%. However, this clearly would not satisfy the objective of this investigation which is to create a classifier that can identify _persons of interest_. Therefore, different metrics are needed to evaluate the tuned algorithm to gauge its effectiveness. The two selected for this project are [Precision and Recall](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Precision_and_recall).\n",
    "\n",

    "$$ precision = \\frac{true\\ positives}{true\\ positives + false\\ positives} $$ \n",

    "\n",
    "$$ recall = \\frac{true\\ positives}{true\\ positives + false\\ negatives} $$ \n",
    "\n",
    "Precision is also known as positive predictive value while recall is the sensitivity of the classifier. A combined measured of precision and recall is the [__F1 score__](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/F1_score). Is it the harmonic mean of precision and recall. Mathematically, the F1 score is defined as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ F1\\ Score = \\frac{2\\ (precision\\ x\\ recall)}{precision + recall} $$\n",

    "<h4> Scaling </h4>\n",
    "\n",
    "The only preparation I will do for this initial testing of the different algorithms is to scale the data such that it has a zero mean and a unit variance. This process is called [normalization](http://www.analytictech.com/ba762/handouts/normalization.htm) and is accomplished using the scale function from the sklearn preprocessing module. Scaling of some form (whether that is MinMax scaling or normalization) is usually necessary because there are different units for the features in the dataset and this process is able to create non-dimensional features. If the features are not scaled, those with a larger units can have an undue influence on the classifier, especially if the classifier uses some sort of measurement (such as Euclidean distance) in order to make predictions. [Here is a good dicussion of feature scaling and normalization](https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/121886/when-should-i-apply-feature-scaling-for-my-data). "

    "<h2> A Quick Note on Validation </h2> \n",
    "\n",
    "The validation strategy I am using here is a form of cross-validation that is implemented in the provided tester.py script. [Cross-validation](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/cross_validation.html) performs multiple splits on the dataset and in each split, forms a different training and testing set. Each iteration, the classifier is fit on a training set and then tested on a testing set. The next iteration the classifier is again trained and tested, but on different sets and this process continues for the number of splits made of the dataset. Cross-validation prevents me from making the classic mistake of training an algoithm on the same data used to test the algorithm. If this happens, the test results may show that the classifier is accurate, but that is only because the algorithm has seen the testing data before. When the classifier is deployed on novel samples, the performance may be poor because it was trained and tuned for a very specific set of instances. The classifier will not be able to generalize to new cases becuase it is only fit and tuned to the specific samples it is trained and tested on. Cross-validation solves this issue by training and testing on multiple different subsets of the features and labels and is ideal for use on small datasets. Throughout my analysis, I used cross-validation to assess the performance of my algorithms. The tester.py script uses the [StratifiedShuffleSplit](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.model_selection.StratifiedShuffleSplit.html) cross-validation method, and GridSearchCV, which is used to find the optimal number of features and the best parameters employs cross validation with the StratifiedKFolds method. In both cases, the number of splits of the dataset is 10. "

The rational behind these choices is that the absolute number of emails from or to a person of interest might not matter so much as the relative number when scaled by the total emails an individual sends or receives. My instinct says that individuals who interact more with a person of interest are themselves more likely to be a person of interest because the fraud was not perpertrated alone and required a net of individuals. However, there are also some innocent persons who may have sent or received many emails from persons of interest simply in the course of their daily (perfectly above the table) work. "

    "At this point I will also create new features using the financial data. I have a few theories that I formed from my initial data exploration and reading about the Enron case. I think that people recieving large bonuses may be more likely to be persons of interest becuase the bonuses could be a result of fraudulent activity, or perhaps a bribe to keep someone quiet. Whatever the case may be, I will create two new features that are the bonus in relation to the salary, and the bonus in relation to total payments. There are now a total of 25 features, some of which are most likely redudant or not of any value. However, I will perform feature reduction/selection eventually so I am not worried about the large number of features. Moreover the algorithms I am using are able to train relatively quickly even with the large number of features because the total amount of data samples is small. "

    "<h1> Feature Selection </h1> \n",
    "\n",
    "There are several methods available for performing feature selection. One is simply to look at the feature importances for a classifier and modify the list of features to exclude those with an importance below a chosen threshold. Another is to use [SelectKBest](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.feature_selection.SelectKBest.html) and have the k-best features automatically selected for use in the classifier. I will look at the feature importances for both the DecisionTree and the AdaBoost Classifier, but I would prefer to use SelectKBest to actually choose the features to keep. Additionally, I can use [GridSearchCV](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.model_selection.GridSearchCV.html) in combination with SelectKBest to find the optimal number of features to use. This will run through a number of k values and choose the one that yields the highest value according to a performance metric. \n",
    "\n",
    "First, I will manually look at the feature importances for both classifiers to get a sense of which features are most important. One of the neat concepts about machine learning is that it can help humans to think smarter. By looking at what the algorithm chooses as the most important features to identify persons of interest, it can inform humans what they should be looking for in similar cases. (One example of this in the real world is when Google's AlphaGo defeated Lee Sedol in Go, it advanced the entire state of Go by providing new [insights and strategies](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dTGthmNmrK4) into a game humans have played for millenia.)"

I can alter this using the __base_estimator__ parameter to tree out a random forest and the gaussian naive bayes classification. Ideally, AdaBoost is used on weak classifiers, or those that perform only slightly better than random. One example would be a [decision stump](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/12097155/weak-classifier) or a decision tree with only a single layer. However, I will try stronger classifiers for the base as well. The other parameters I can change are __n_estimators__ which is how many weak models to fit and __learning_rate__, a measure of the weight given to each classifier."

    "I was somewhat surprised by the high F1 score of 0.905 that my final model achieved using the tester.py script. I was afraid that I had somehow overfit my model to the data even though the script implements cross-validation. Looking through the tester.py script, I saw that the [random seed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_seed) for the cross-validation split was set at 42 in order to generate reproducible results. I changed the random seed and sure enough, the performance of my model decreased. Therefore, I must made the classic mistake of overfitting on my training set for the given cross-validation split. I decided to run 10 tests with different random seeds to get a better indicator of the performance of the classifier. The final results for my model are summarized below:\n",

    "The largest takeaway from this project was the important of quality data as compared to fine-tuning the algorithm. Feature engineering, through creating new features and selecting the most relevant ones, increased the F1 score of the classifier from ~ 0.40 to ~ 0.70. However, tuning the hyperparameters of the algorithm only increased the F1 score to 0.80. Subsequently, when developing future machine learning models, I will focus on collecting as much high-quality data as I can before I even think about training and tuning the algorithm. This point was elucidated in a [2009 paper from Alon Halevy and Peter Norvig](https://static.googleusercontent.com/media/research.google.com/en//pubs/archive/35179.pdf) titled \"The Unreasonable Effectiveness of Data.\" The main argument of the paper is that as the amount of valid data increases, the choice of algorithm matters less and less and even the simplest algorithm can match the performance of the most highly tuned model. Moreover, this project showed me that human intuition about a situation will not always match the results returned by an algorithm. For example, I would have thought that the most highly predictive indicators of fradulent activity would be emails to/from persons of interest. Using automatic feature selection however showed that the order of importance was bonus, from\\_poi\\_ratio, salary, total\\_stock\\_value. My intuition was partly correct, but the algorithm also had other ideas for what mattered. Nonetheless, this discrepancy provides a chance to learn from the machine and update my mindset. Ultimately, I see the end game of machine learning is not to outsource all human decisions, but using computing power to provide insights from data that can inform smarter thinking and enable humans to create more efficient systems.

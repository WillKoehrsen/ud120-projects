Code for this project was written in a Jupyter Notebook and the final version was transferred to the poi_id.py script. 
The Jupyter Notebook is a complete report of my process and contains the answers to the provided questions for the project.  
Any sources used in this project are linked to in the report. I must also give credit to provisional scripts and resources from the Udacity Data Analyst Machine Learning Course!
